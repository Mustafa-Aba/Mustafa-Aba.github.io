##This repo was created using multiple artificial intelligence tools. This is a personal portfolio website. The following prompts were used.

##Prompt 1: I want you to act as a web developer. For the personal website portfolio project you will code a new website using the following tools: Bootstrap framework using CDN for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website must be mobile-friendly and responsive. It should also include the latest version of Twitter Bootstrap CSS classes in the site structure in terms of layout and style. It is important to provide HTML, CSS and JavaScript code as separate outputs. Do you understand everything? Please answer yes or no if you understand all the requirements

##Prompt 2: I am a software test engineer. I want you to create a personal website portfolio for me. The tags I want to have on the website are (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer). Additionally, you should add a navigation menu with internal links to the headings in the page content. You must use 3 tools: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site should open in dark mode by default, but the user should be able to switch the site to Light mode by clicking on the Light mode icon.

##Prompt 3:The header section of the site should contain the following content: On the left side, there should be a logo and a Home button, and on the right side, aligned horizontally, there should be About Me, Resume, Portfolio, Contact buttons. The header section should be fixed, and it should not disappear when the user scrolls down. When the user clicks on the Logo and Home button, they should be directed to the Home page. Users should be able to send me a message via the contact form. Users should only be able to see the content of the section they click on. Use visual elements and animations such as page transitions, loading animations, and visual highlights.

##Prompt 4:On the homepage, there should be a text "Hello, I'm [Name]" and immediately below it, there should be a text "Software Test Engineer". Font size: 48px. Below the "Software Test Engineer" text, there should be 2 separate buttons: Contact Me and View Resume. When clicked on Contact Me button, the user should be directed to the Contact page, and when clicked on View Resume button, they should be directed to the Resume page. On the Resume page, there should be a button named Download Resume, and when the user clicks on the button, they should be able to download the desired PDF file.

##Prompt 5:On the Portfolio page, there should be images of 3 projects, and when hovered over the image, the Project Name and View Project button should be displayed with a hover effect. When the user clicks on the View Project button, they should be directed to the project's GitHub page. It would be a nice detail to have a transition effect when hovering over the images.

##Prompt 6:On the Contact page, there should be fields for User Name, Email, Message, and a Send button. After entering the necessary information, the user should be able to send me an email by clicking on the Send button. The logo should be placed in the footer section.

##Prompt 7:SEO Friendly Design. Make the website search engine friendly by adding appropriate title tags, meta descriptions, clean URLs, and optimized images. Maintain regular communication and exchange feedback throughout the progress of the project.
